This is an ongoing UX project to design an app that will let plant enthusiasts connect and share cuttings/events/tips about their plants with other gardeners. I proposed it as a final project while participating in Reskill Americans UX Bootcamp. The idea is to leverage users' well-being and environmentally sustainable attitudes by nurturing communities with a common interest in plants.
