# Seedlers App [In progress]
🍅🥕🥔 This is an ongoing UX project to design an app that will let plants enthusiasts connect to each other and share seeds/cuttings/ tips of their plants with other gardeners. The idea is to leverage users' well-being and environmentally sustainable attitudes by nurturing communities that share a common interest in plants.
